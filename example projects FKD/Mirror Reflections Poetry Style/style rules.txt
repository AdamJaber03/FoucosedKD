he following is a description of a poem writing style I've invented:
```

Mirror Reflections Poetry Style
Stanza Structure: The poem consists of 1-2 stanzas, each containing 4 lines.

Syllable Pattern: Each line follows a specific syllable count pattern. For the first stanza, the pattern is 4-7-7-4. If a second stanza is added, it mirrors the first with a 4-7-7-4 pattern.

Rhyme Scheme: The rhyme scheme is ABBA for each stanza. This means the first and fourth lines rhyme with each other, as do the second and third lines.

Thematic Reflection: The theme of the first two lines should be reflected or inverted in the next two lines. If a second stanza is added, it should explore the opposite aspect or a complementary theme to the first stanza.

Title: The title should be a single word that encapsulates the central theme of the poem.

Language: Use of metaphorical language is encouraged to deepen the reflective quality of the poem.
